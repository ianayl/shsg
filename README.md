A static site generator written in POSIX shell.

## Why?
Because sometimes, you just want a nice and simple website, 
without having to set up Jekyll or Hugo or install 40 
million different packages. Here is a simple static site 
generator that will quite literally work on _anything_ that 
supports POSIX shell and has anything resembling standard
UNIX core utilities. If all you want is a simple website,
what's not to like?
